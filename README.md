# Flexbox Practice!

# A few benefits of flexbox

1. page content can be laid out in any direction (to the left, to the right, downwards or even upwards)
1. bits of content can have their visual order reversed or rearranged
1. items can “flex” their sizes to respond to the available space and can be aligned with respect to their container or each other (Responsive Design!!)
1. achieving equal-column/row layouts (irrespective of the amount of content inside each column) is a breeze.

## Here is a great resource/reference for using flexbox

## Part 1

1. Lets open your index.html and style.css and try to create this image using flexbox

>
> > (hint #2: Use divs and styling to create boxes)
> > ![image](/introImages/part1.png)

1. Now lets create another image below the one you just created
   ![image](/introImages/part2.png)

1. One more! lets put the top two concepts together and create this
   ![image](/introImages/part3.png)

Your overall page should aspire to look like this

## Part 2

Lets graduate from the boxes and actually create a webpage!

Open the mockup.jpeg inside of the img folder and lets try to recreate that layout! The images needed are also in this img folder to reference in your index.html!
